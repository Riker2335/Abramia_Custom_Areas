# Isla Abramia Custom Areas - Created by Riker2335 for Exile

This is a collection of custom areas that I created for my Arma 3 Exile server running Isla Abramia. Buildings are a combination of ARMA 3, Cup Core and Abramia buildings. The areas were all created in 3Den Editor over the course of 2017 and 2018. All are compatible with V3.9 of the map.

# Installation Instructions
Method 1 - Simple but can get complex if you want lots of different areas added
1. Copy the content from .sqf file you want in the subfolders of "Abramia Custom Areas" into your initserver.sqf file inside your mission file.
2. Repack your mission file and upload to the server

Method 2 - Better if you want lots of areas
1. Download the SQF file(s) from these subfolders that you're interested in
2. Setup this: http://www.exilemod.com/topic/5604-include-your-custom-objects-and-buildings-in-a-server-addon/#comment-20386 on your server
3. Follow the instructions from point 7 for adding new sqf file(s) to the server

# Mission files
As I no longer operate an Abramia server, in case future changes are needed to these areas I've included the mission files with all the objects. 
Simply create a folder in your MPMISSIONS folder where all other new mission files are created on your PC and paste the mission.sqm file in there. Just open it in 3DEN and you can adjust as needed.
Please note that when I created these custom areas, I had all mods loaded that my server was using at the time. This included the map itself, CUP Core, Exile's client files and numerous custom mods such as CUP Weapons/Vehicles, Zombies and Demons, Z-Hunters, Extended Items Exile, Extended Base Mod and TRYK. Some of these may be required to edit these files.
